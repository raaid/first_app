    <p>You win, the event organizer wins and the guests win as well.</p>    
    <br />
    <h3>Heres how it works:</h3>  
    <br />
    <p>1	click on link, Register with completed form </p>
    <p>2	Wait account approval, from the Eventastic Team </p>
    <p>3	Set up links, website widget,  and events listings page site color matched</p>
    <p>4	Promote event and earn money and increase traffic flow to your site </p>
    <p>5	Look to our optional Commission program to motivate you and your staff </p>
    <br />
      <h3>Welcome the Event Rep program,</h3>
    <br />
    <p>Commission Sales people to help you sell tickets on our platform </p>
    <p>Eventastic has launched a feature to help you get help selling tickets and keeping people motivated to making you event a success.  We all know that when it comes to free help they tend to be less committed to the cause then you are.  Now with a single email you can appoint people as commissioned sales people to get them out and selling. </p>
    <p>Lets say you are hosting an event,  the capacity of the venue is 350 people.  Your Eventastic page is finished and your ticketing functions are waiting guest. You initially wanted to sell tickets for $11.00 but decided to turbo charge sales by adding $4.00  making it a $15.00 ticket.  Yeah! I said that,  increase price in this way and it will increase sales. </p> 
    <p>Simple go to your management dashboard and put in name and email address of people that said they would help you sell tickets or your staff.  They will get an email and a link that they each individually use to promote your event.    Now every ticket they sell generates a $4.00 commission for them. Now they are motivated.</p> 
    <p>Your Dashboard will always at a glance show you who is working hard for you and what sales they have achieved,  what sales you have achieve and what the total tickets sold are, at any given point.  At Event organizers cash out,  we coordinate  everything for you and you simple click  an allocation button to issue them the money they earned promoting you.  Its that simple.   You can even change their commission to increase sales if you find you  are needing to bump the numbers immediately before an event…… </p>
