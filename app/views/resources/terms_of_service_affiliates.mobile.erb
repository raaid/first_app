<h3>5. PAYMENT METHODS FOR ORGANIZERS.</h3>
<br />
<h3>5.1 Overview. </h3>
<br />
There are two types of payment processing options Organizers may elect when using the Services: (1) "Facilitated Payment Processing" or "FPP", which consists of collecting Event Registration Fees using FPMs; and (2) "Credit Card Processing" or "CCP", which requires the use of the Gateway for the collection of Event Registration Fees. Depending on the payment processing option the Organizer elects when using the Services, monetary payments will be made to the Organizer directly by Buyers (via FPP) or by Giftopia (via CCP), in each case as described below.
<br /><br />
<h3>5.2 Facilitated Payment Processing.</h3>
<br />
<h3>(a) Independent Relationship.</h3>
<br />
When using a FPM, Organizers and Buyers effect the applicable monetary payment transaction through the FPM service and are bound by the applicable terms of use governing the FPM service.
<br /><br />
<h3>(b) Services Fees.</h3>
<br />
Organizers will collect all monies directly from Buyers under the FPP option. By registering for and using the FPP option, you agree to (i) pay Giftopia all then-applicable Giftopia Service Fees and Credit Card Processing Fees, which are based on the number of tickets sold by you and/or the value of such tickets, and which charges are described in greater detail and all additional on-site service fees, equipment lease charges, printed ticket fees, and any other fees and charges of any kind payable by you to Giftopia in connection with the provision of the Services (collectively, "Service Fees"), which payments shall be due and payable upon receipt of the invoice setting forth such charges; and (ii) accept the responsibility for providing refunds to Buyers at your own discretion. Giftopia will not be responsible or liable for, and Organizer hereby agrees to fully indemnify Giftopia and its affiliates for, refunds, errors in issuing refunds, or lack of refunds in connection with the use of the FPP option. Invoices are sent monthly for Service Fees incurred in the previous month.
<br /><br />
<h3>5.3 Credit Card Processing.</h3>
<br />
<h3>(a) Gateway; Payment Process.</h3>
<br />
When an Organizer elects to use the Gateway for the collection of Event Registration Fees, payment processing occurs directly through Giftopia Under the CCP option, Giftopia will collect all Event Registration Fees on behalf of the Organizer from Buyers and deduct all applicable Services Fees from the Event Registration Fees collected by Giftopia, and then pass the remainder along to the Organizer within five (5) business days after the event end date for the event to which the Event Registration Fees correspond (either by mailing a check or through an electronic funds transfer, depending on the option the Organizer has chosen through using the Site, to the address or account, respectively, that the Organizer accurately designates on the Site), provided that Giftopia reserves the right to withhold funds (i) at any time as Giftopia determines to be necessary for the processing and settlement of all refunds, disputed charges, chargebacks, customer complaints, allegations of fraud, and other discrepancies and (ii) as otherwise permitted pursuant to this TOS. Giftopia, in its sole discretion, may determine to advance a portion of Event Registration Fees to Organizer prior to the period set forth above, on such terms and conditions as Giftopia may establish from time to time. Organizer agrees that all Event Registration Fees for a given event are earned by Organizer only following conclusion of the applicable event and all Event Registration Fees ultimately due will be net of all Service Fees, refunds, disputed charges, chargebacks and other deductions, whether due to customer complaints, allegations of fraud, discrepancies related to the applicable event or otherwise. No payments shall be made to an Organizer from Giftopia with respect to any event that is cancelled. If payments have already been made by Giftopia to an Organizer for a cancelled event, such Organizer will immediately refund to Giftopia all such payments upon cancellation of such event. All sales, fees, charges, and funds are payable in U.S. Dollars, or other foreign currencies accepted by Giftopia If Organizer elects to list Event Registration Fees in a foreign currency accepted by Giftopia, Giftopia will collect and disperse the funds in the foreign currency selected by Organizer.
<br />
ORGANIZER AGREES THAT ANY PAYMENT BY GIFTOPIA OF EVENT REGISTRATION FEES PRIOR TO THE FIFTH (5TH) BUSINESS DAY AFTER THE END DATE OF THE APPLICABLE EVENT ARE MERELY ADVANCES OF AMOUNTS THAT MAY BECOME DUE TO ORGANIZER UNDER THIS TOS AND THAT GIFTOPIA MAY DEMAND SUCH ADVANCES BACK (FROM TIME TO TIME IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION), AND ORGANIZER SHALL THEREUPON PROMPTLY (AND IN ANY CASE WITHIN FIVE (5) BUSINESS DAYS AFTER SUCH DEMAND) PAY BACK TO GIFTOPIA SUCH ADVANCE OR ANY PORTION THEREOF DEMANDED BY Giftopia
<br /><br />
<h3>(b) Refunds.</h3>
<br />
(i) Under the CCP option, it is the responsibility of the Organizer to communicate its refund policy to Buyers and to issue refunds to Buyers via the Site. An Organizer shall ensure that its refund policy is consistent with the terms of this TOS and the payment and refund mechanics of the Site. The Site permits an Organizer to issue refunds to Buyers, provided the refund is issued by Organizer before ninety-six (96) hours after the end date of an event and within six (6) months after the transaction date for the underlying ticket purchase. Refunds issued following such period will not be processed through the Site, unless otherwise agreed to by Giftopia in its sole discretion. Subject to the foregoing, refunds issued by an Organizer will be processed within thirty (30) days after Organizer instructs the issuance of the refunds via the Site. All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Organizer and Buyer, and Giftopia will not be responsible or liable for, and Organizer hereby agrees to fully indemnify Giftopia and its affiliates for, refunds, errors in issuing refunds, or lack of refunds in connection with the use of the CCP option. (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that Giftopia shall have the right to force a refund of any or all tickets at any time for any reason or no reason, including without limitation if Giftopia receives complaints from a substantial number (as determined by Giftopia in its sole discretion) of Buyers with respect to the applicable event or another event held by Organizer, or Giftopia determines in its sole discretion that Organizer has engaged in any fraudulent activity or made any misrepresentations. Further, if one or more Buyer(s) request a refund, whether due to a cancelled event or for any other reason where Giftopia would reasonably expect to lose a chargeback, Giftopia may, in its sole discretion, issue such refund to such Buyer(s), and Organizer shall then owe the amount of such refund to Giftopia
<br /><br />
<h3>(c) Credit Card Chargebacks.</h3>
<br />
Under the CCP option, any credit card chargebacks initiated by a Buyer for any reason with respect to an event shall be charged back to the Organizer of such event. All communications and disputes regarding chargebacks are between the Organizer and Buyer, and Giftopia will not be responsible or liable in any way for, and Organizer hereby agrees to fully indemnify Giftopia and its affiliates for, chargebacks issued in the course of the use of the CCP option.
<br /><br />
<h3>5.4 Non-Exclusive Remedies. </h3>
<br />
<h3>(a) Payment.</h3>
<br />
In the event that Organizer fails to pay to Giftopia any amount owed pursuant to this TOS when due, such amount shall bear interest calculated from the date due until paid in full at a rate equal to the lesser of (a) ten percent (10%) per annum, and (b) the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. In the event any amounts are owed by Organizer to Giftopia under this TOS or otherwise, Giftopia may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, (i) deduct such amounts from Organizer's outstanding balance, whether for that particular event or for any other event that Organizer lists through the Services; and/or (ii) send an invoice to Organizer for such amounts to the extent Organizer's outstanding balance is insufficient to cover these costs, in which case Organizer shall pay Giftopia such invoiced amounts within thirty (30) days after the date of the invoice. If payment for any amounts due to Giftopia hereunder are not made by Organizer when due, Giftopia reserves the right, in its sole discretion and without limiting its other rights and remedies, to terminate Organizer's registration for the Services (including any and all accounts that Organizer may have) and to cancel all other events listed by Organizer.

Giftopia will contact you during the year for this information if you meet these thresholds.<br />
