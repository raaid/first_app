    <h2>With a single name and email address, you can appoint a friend, family or employee as commissioned sales reps empowering them to Sell! Sell! Sell!</h2>
    <br />
    <p>Event organizers can now easily manage all scheduling and invitation aspects of the event as well as manage revenue and commissions within the application itself.  Payout is automated and one click away. Include your venue for additional in house support and motivate them to advertise your event.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Leverage this amazing method to pack the house each time! </h2>
    <br />
    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <br />
    <p>An Eventastic event is created for a maximum capacity of 350 guests and is awaiting purchasers. The initial ticket price is $11.00, but you want the event to be a sell-out with the support of sales reps, so you round up the ticket price by $4.00, making it $15.00 per ticket.  You read that right – you’re going to increase the ticket price to increase sales volume.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Now go to your Commission Management Dashboard and input the names and email addresses of your sales reps. Each person will receive an email and a link personalized for them to use in the promotion of the event. Each sales rep will use their own link to track their sales and receive their $4.00 commission.</p>
    <br />
    <h3>A motivated sales team = higher ticket sales = a more successful event</h3>
    <br />
    <p>At a glance of your Dashboard, you will be able to see who has sold the most tickets, and what the total sales are at any given point. If sales are sluggish and you think you need to “up the ante” you can increase commissions to boost sales prior to the event.</p>
    <br />
    <p>When an Event Organizer “cashes out” their event, all you have to do is click an allocation button to issue commissions to your sales reps – it’s that simple.</p>
