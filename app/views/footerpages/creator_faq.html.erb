    <h1>FAQs - ORGANIZERS</h1>
    <br />

    <h2>Can I obtain a refund or exchange once I’ve purchased my tickets?</h2>
    <ul style="list-style:square; padding:10px">
      <li><p>Refunds and exchanges are the responsibility of the Event Organizer. It is the responsibility of the Event Organizer to communicate the refund policy and to issue refunds to Buyers via the Site or otherwise. All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Organizer and Buyer. Giftopia is not responsible or liable in any way for refunds, errors in issuing refunds, or lack of refunds in connection with the Services. </p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How much does it cost use Eventastic?</h2>
    <ul style="list-style:square; padding:10px">
      <li><p>If you keep it free, then we keep it free! Don’t believe it? Create a test event and try us on for size. There are no monthly charges, enrollment or set-up fees. If you are selling tickets to your event, service fees will apply, but you can choose to include the fees in your ticket price or absorb the cost.</p></b></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>I'm charging for my event. Can I have my attendees pay the Eventastic fee?</h2>
    <ul style="list-style:square; padding:10px">
      <li><p>Yes, when you create your event, select the option “Charge Processing Fees to Customer Instead Of Covering It Yourself (2.9% + $0.30/transaction)”, found in event options of your management dashboard.  The fees will then be added to the attendee’s total ticket price.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Is this platform restricted to small events?</h2>
    <ul style="list-style:square; padding:10px">
      <li><p>Eventastic can help you manage events of any size – from a small family gathering, to a 20,000 person rock concert. This tool is flexible enough to meet the needs of your event. </p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How are the transactions processed?</h2>

    <ul style="list-style:square;padding:10px">
      <li><p>All transactions are processed through PayPal.</p></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>What are the transaction fees?</h2>
    <ul style="list-style:square; padding:10px">
      <li><p>We keep it free when you keep it free. Revenue-generating events incur one of the lowest service fees available in the industry:</p></li>
      <li><p>Service Fees = 2.5% of transaction + scaled ticket processing fee (0₵ - 99₵ based on ticket price) + applicable PayPal fees </p></li>
      <li><p>Our service fees are capped at $9.99 for any large ticket item that is over $400.00. The larger the cost of a ticketed item, the less you pay by percentage per ticket.</p></li>
      <li><p>Organizers utilizing the Cash Gifting or Online Donation function will incur 2.5% processing fee only.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Can I set privacy settings for an event?</h2>
    <ul style="list-style:square; padding:10px">
      <li><p>Yes, you can make any event private and only your guests will be able to view the details via the private event page link you share with them.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why can’t I find my event in the search?</h2>
    <ul style="list-style:square; padding:10px">
      <li><p>You may have indicated your event was private. Go to edit event details and at the publish stage we provide the option to make an event private or public. If you want your event to be public make sure this box is not checked.</p></li>
        <li><p>If you need further assistance resolving this issue, email <a href="mailto:support@eventastic.com"><b>support@eventastic.com</b></a></p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Can I link an event to my Facebook?</h2>
    <ul style="list-style:square;padding:10px">
       <li><p>Yes, you may promote your event through social media channels such as Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest. Make it easy for people to learn about your event and watch your attendance rates soar. </p></li> 
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Can I duplicate event?</h2>
    <ul style="list-style:square; padding:10px">
      <li><p>Yes, we call that cloning. In your event dashboard, simply click clone this event for the event you want to duplicate, update the necessary details such as date, time, and location then save your event. </p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How and when do I get the money for the event?</h2>
      <ul style="list-style:square; padding:10px ">
        <li><p>All transactions are processed through PayPal and transfer orders are usually processed within 24 hours upon request for check out.</p></li>
      </ul>
